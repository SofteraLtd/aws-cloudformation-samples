# AWS CloudFormation Samples

These samples are developed and shared as part of Softera Blog posts.

The templates are organised in such a way that it should be pretty straight forward to find the associated blog entry for each template. Furthermore, each template also provides a direct link within from the 'Description' attribute that takes to the original blog post on Softera's website.
